        <img src="killbill.jpg" width="400">
        <p>I'm still a fan even though I was salty
        Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
        Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving</p>
        <p>I'm so mature, I'm so mature
        I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
        I don't want none, I just want you
        If I can't have you, no one should
        I might</p>
        <p>I might kill my ex, not the best idea
        His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
        I might kill my ex, I still love him though
        Rather be in jail than alone</p>
        <p>I get the sense that it's a lost cause
        I get the sense that you might really love her
        The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
        I tried to ration with you, no murders or crimes of passion, but damn</p>
        <p>You was out of reach
        You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
        Now I'm in the basement, planning home invasion
        Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat</p>
        <p>I'm so mature, I'm so mature
        I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
        I don't want none, I just want you
        If I can't have you, no one will
        (I might)</p>
        <p>I might kill my ex, not the best idea
        His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
        I might kill my ex, I still love him though
        Rather be in jail than alone</p>
        <p>I did it all for love (love)
        I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
        I did all of this sober
        I did it all for us, oh</p>
        <p>I did it all for love (love)
        I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)
        I did all of this sober</p>
        Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ass tonight)
        <p>Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)
        Not the best idea (idea)
        Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
        I just killed my ex (my ex)
        I still love him, though (I do)
        Rather be in Hell than alone</p>
