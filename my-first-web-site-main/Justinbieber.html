                <p>For all the times that you rained on my parade
                And all the clubs you get in using my name
                You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
                You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't</p>
                <p style="margin-top:40px">And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
                You still hit my phone up
                And baby, I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
                Maybe you should know that</p>
                <p>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job
                Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
                I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
                <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself</p>
                <p>But when you told me that you hated my friends
                The only problem was with you and not them
                And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
                And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
                <p>And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
                You still hit my phone up
                And baby, I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
                Maybe you should know that</p>

                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job
                Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
                I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
                <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much

                You should go and love yourself</p>
                <p>For all the times that you made me feel small
                I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
                I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
                Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
                <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself</p>
                <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
                And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
                Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
                You should go and love yourself</p>
