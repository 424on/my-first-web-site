    <p>It's true
    That all that you know is all that you are
    You said that it's all that you want and more
    Fuck off and pour another drink
    And tell me what you think
    You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
    You put your cigarette out on my face
    So beautiful, please, woman</p>
    <p>Don't break your back for me
    I'll put you out of your misery</p>
    <p>Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
    I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
    Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
    I'm here, but don't count on me to</p>
    <p>Stay a little longer if you convince me
    And tell me all the things that you have against me
    Every time we make-up, the truth is fadin'
    Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
    Damn, who are we right now?
    Can we have a little conversation?
    Figure it out with no intoxication
    We carry on, what is our motivation?
    We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
    Maybe we're used to this
    Tell me, what are we to do?
    It's like we only play to lose
    Chasin' pain with an excuse
    I love that shit and so do you</p>
    <p>But don't break your back for me
    I'll put you out of your misery</p>
    <p>Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
    I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
    Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
    I'm here, but don't count on me to stay</p>
    <p>Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
    I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
    Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
    I'm here, but don't count on me to stay</p>
